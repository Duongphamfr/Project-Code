At the age of 14, he entered the famous boarding school called Sherborne, he showed a passion and aptitude for math and science, so much so that he only studied these two subjects and skipped other subjects. He is described by everyone as a person with autism-Asperger syndrome, which manifests as a preference for social isolation, dislike of group games, clumsiness in life, and a tinge of learning. non-stop creativity.</p>\r\n                        <p>During high school, he realized he was gay and fell in love in his youth with a classmate named Christopher Morcom, a man with a tragic fate who died of tuberculosis. before graduating from high school. It is possible that this was a major event for Turing and caused a great wound in his heart that prevented him from easily opening his heart to a more personal relationship.</p>\r\n                        <p>After learning about the problem, Turing worked hard from spring 1935 to 1936 to answer the third question. And at the suggestion of Cambridge math professor Max Newman, who taught Turing about Hillbert\'s problem. Turing thought of an \"imaginary machine\" as a \"mechanical process\" to determine a given logical proposition and apply it to the problem. And he finally proved Hilbert\'s third problem to be impossible, using what would come to be known as a Turing machine, which was the premise for computing as well as informatics.</p>\r\n                        <a href=\"#!\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"../assets/img/img post/6_1.jpg\" alt=\"...\" /></a>\r\n                        <span class=\"caption text-muted\">“Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.” - Alan Turing</span>\r\n                        <p>But perhaps we know him better thanks to the film The Imitation Game (2014) which tells the historical true story of Turing directing and designing the Nazi enigma decoder, a type of code to translate the way information travels through radio pulses in the form of Morse telegraphs. This is an important key to ending the persistent World War II, and according to many experts, the war ended 2 years early, reducing countless casualties as well as war costs and costs. all thanks to Turing and his colleagues. And imagine, at that time Germany was at the forefront of Atomic Science, if the war drags on it is not known which side will have the advantage then, Chancellor Brown also wrote. : \"Without Turing\'s outstanding service, World War II history would have been very different.\"</p>\r\n                        <p>Despite its great contribution to the war, all the information of the decryption team was classified as state secret and was destroyed shortly after the war ended. All the scientific achievements and great merits of Turing are almost unknown to anyone. Since 1945, he concurrently worked at the National Physics Laboratory, studying computer theory. In 1946 he was awarded the OBE Medal by the British Royal Family, a rather high honor. In the years 1947-1948 he researched the problem of artificial intelligence, working as Deputy Director of the Computational Laboratory at the University of Manchester. In 1949 Turing became the first scientist to actually use computers to study mathematics. In 1950 he published the thesis \"Computer and Intelligence\", giving the famous \"Turing Test\", which laid the foundation for the science of artificial intelligence. In 1951 he began to study the non-linear theory of organisms. At the age of 39, Turing was elected a member of the Royal Scientific Society (this title is also known as an academician).</p>\r\n                        <p>But unfortunately all the events happened to Turing when he was discovered to be gay in 1952, with the law at that time, Turing was convicted of \"perverting fine customs\", \"gross indecency\" from the government. the nation is indebted to him. To \"punish\" for that crime, he was forced to inject female hormones into his body, also known as \"chemical castration\". The sentence had a huge negative effect on both his body and soul, leading to his suicide on June 7, 1954 when he was just about to turn 42 years old, the age still has many contributions. promise to the world and could never see the tremendous growth of the Science he had begun.</p>\r\n                        <h2 class=\"section-heading\">The world\'s belated apology</h2>\r\n                        <p>With his huge contribution to Science and glorious war achievements, instead of being a proud British man, he was not really recognized adequately because of the stigma against him. gay people. Until 2009, the British government had to publicly send this perhaps belated apology to Turing.</p>\r\n                        <a href=\"#!\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"../assets/img/img post/6_2.jpg\" alt=\"...\" /></a>\r\n                        <span class=\"caption text-muted\">“Apologies are great, but they don’t really change anything.
